Business Plan: Healthcare Generator Maintenance in Miami-Dade & Broward
________________


1. Market Opportunity
Regulatory Drivers
* Florida law (post-Hurricane Irma) mandates all nursing homes and assisted living facilities to maintain backup power capable of sustaining safe temperatures for 72 hours.

* Facilities must keep documented maintenance, quarterly inspections, and annual load test logs ready for AHCA (Agency for Health Care Administration) inspectors.

* Hospitals and clinics are also held to strict generator readiness standards due to Joint Commission and OSHA requirements.

👉 This creates compliance-driven demand — services are not optional.
Addressable Market
   * Miami-Dade County: ~53 nursing homes, ~600+ ALFs, ~30 hospitals.

   * Broward County: ~80 nursing homes, ~400+ ALFs, ~30 hospitals.

   * Combined: 1,100+ healthcare facilities legally mandated to maintain backup power.

Differentiators
         * Compliance-First: Digital, inspection-ready reports with timestamps and AHCA-ready formats.

         * Faster Service: Guaranteed 4-hour or same-day emergency response.

         * Bilingual Teams: Serving Miami and Broward’s diverse populations effectively.

4. Go-to-Market Strategy
Entry Point
                     * Target mid-sized ALFs and nursing homes first — faster sales cycles, steady recurring revenue, high compliance pain.

Sales Channels
                        * Direct outreach to facility administrators.

                        * Partnerships with eldercare associations and compliance consultants.

                        * Educational content on AHCA compliance and generator readiness.

5. Operations
Staffing
                              * Start with 2–3 certified generator technicians.

                              * One compliance manager (overseeing digital reporting & client portal).

                              * Contract out parts supply until scale justifies in-house inventory.

Tools & Systems
                                 * Field service management software with dispatch + reporting.

                                 * Client-facing compliance portal.

7. Competitive Landscape
Current Providers
                                             * Generator companies servicing all industries, not specialized in healthcare.

                                             * Common client complaints: slow response, poor documentation.

👉 Opportunity to stand out with compliance + speed + healthcare-only positioning.
